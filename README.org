#+TITLE: README
#+STARTUP: overview

Code snippets and exercises from [[https://man7.org/tlpi/][The Linux Programming Interface]] written in Rust. All the projects use [[https://github.com/nix-rust/nix][nix]] to interface with libc.

**** Things that could be better
***** [ ] Add better documentation
***** [ ] Return code from main should reflect Linux error code (in case of error)
